# breakout
A version of the classic Breakout / Through the Wall game written in Python with Pygame.

This was inspired by the game "Thro' the Wall" for the 48K ZX Spectrum, which came on the 'Horizons Starter Tape' 
(see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizons:_Software_Starter_Pack] ) and was the first game I played on it.
